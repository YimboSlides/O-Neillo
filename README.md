This project was created as part of my assignment for my first year at uni as a degree apprentice. The program is a version of the board game 'Othello', incorporating many elements of programming covered in my first year module.

The project incorporates a class, known as 'GameboardImageArray', which was developed by my lecturers to support students who
did not feel confident enough to develop parts of the code responsible for rendering the GUI. This class, in addition to the images supplied for the tiles and playing pieces, and the images for the order-of-play arrow are the only elements of my project that are not my own work.

As for the structure of my code, the majority of the game logic is present within the 'Player.cs' and 'Board.cs' files. All of the UI interactivity features are also a part of the 'Board.cs' file. The data is saved to a single JSON file called 'game_data'.
